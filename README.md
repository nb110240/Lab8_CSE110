# Lab 8 - Starter
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

Ans: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. 

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

Ans: No

3) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

Ans: Yes I would use unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. Unit tests are used to test small parts of a code. the "message" feature is a small part of the entire application. Unit tests could be used to check the send messaging fucntion.

4) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

Ans: yes I would use unit tests to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application. It is still a small feature compared to the entire application hence it makes sense to still use unit testing.
